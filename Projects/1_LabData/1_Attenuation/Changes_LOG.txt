BH: Feb 14, 2015: 
restructured this directory so that it works like 2_PLATES... state variable are listed in Make_DATA, and other potential ones that may be more general are in params_state (not sure how this will be used yet).. make_SVs will read in from "Data" structure, and the vectors of state variables for VBR are generated there, 
but all scaling and related material properties are only using the SCALING parameter files (Params_QMV_Scaling.m) that is in VBR ! This has been consolidated. 
this is important for centralization of definition of all important scaling parameters.
