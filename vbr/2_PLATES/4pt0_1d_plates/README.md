# Thermal_Evolution

This directory contains a forward model for the thermal evolution of the upper mantle. The main purpose of the code is to generate a suite of thermodynamic states from which the VBR calculator can calculate seismic properties that can be compared to observations. Hence, the code is a rather simple forward model of the 1-D heat equation with variable thermal conductivity.

See manual for full description of the model formulation and  `Projects/runThermalModel` for a detailed example of how to run the code.
