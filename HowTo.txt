first fit the plate thickness.. 
find depth of RF LAb

1) DRIVE_SVFM_Plate.. 
2) DRIVE_VBR
3) DRIVE_TNA_SNA_fit
pick the value of the zPlate that gives the best zLAB. 

Then add melt: 
1) DRIVE_AddMelt
2) DRIVE_VBR (with wMelt_flag = 1) 
3) DRIVE_TNA_SNA_fit (with wMelt_flag = 1) 

======================================
TO dO with chris: 

why is time steps saved not linear…  ?  
how is dt determined? adaptive?

how to interpret “end of run” messages ? 
plotting: show all vars
