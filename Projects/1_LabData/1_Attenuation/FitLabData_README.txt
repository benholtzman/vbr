# README: Fitting experimental data

(1) Assemble the experimental data-- this is currently done in "Make_DATA.m",
that builds a data structure with data entered by hand from different labs, with all conditions.
Data needs to be added to this. It can be read from files into this structure..

(2) Plot each lab's data with their fitting and scaling model... and then make the matrix of
lab data vs fitting model.



Questions:
(1) Yamauchi/Takei reference grain size = grain size? so there is no grain size dependence?
(2) Faul/Jackson 2015 fit to the San Carlos data in Fig 4 (unpublished data) cannot have a dG/dT of -13.x, 
has to be about -25-- Ask Uli about this
