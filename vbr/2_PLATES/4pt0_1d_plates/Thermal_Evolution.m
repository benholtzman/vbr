%%% 1D finite-volume solution to heat equation
%
% Many initial conditions and material settings are controlled by the 
% functions in 01_functions/ and 01_init_conds_and_material. 
% These functions are all called by driver.m before calling TwoPhase. 
%
% For finite volume, scalar quantities (pressure, melt fraction) are 
% solved at cell centers while velocities are defined on cell edges.
%
% Initial conditions are given as input on cell edges. 
% 
% Final Output is output on cell edges in 2D arrays where each column 
% corresponds to a single timestep. i.e., phi(:,3) is the melt fraction
% profile at time step 3. Variables are stored in the Vars structure:
